Welcome to nb2fasthtml-blog! ðŸŒŸ

Do you love Jupyter notebooks but find traditional blogging platforms a bit limiting? You're in the right place!

This demo blog is designed to make it as easy and fun as possible by allowing you to:

* Create blog posts as standard .ipynb files
* Render your blog posts as beautiful, fast-loading HTML blog posts with the power of [nb2fasthtml](https://github.com/answerdotai/nb2fasthtml)
* Get right to blogging with no extra front matter to remember. The notebook's title is the blog post title.

## Why This Matters

Jupyter notebooks are such a joy to experiment in! My goal here is to make turning those experiments into blog posts just as effortless. 

## About the Demo Blog Posts

For the demo "blog posts" I copied the notebooks from https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/til/tree/main/nbs to nbs/
and added a couple more notebooks for testing.

## Quickstart

Clone this repo, install the requirements, then:

```sh
python main.py
```
